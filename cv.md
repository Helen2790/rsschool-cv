## About Myself:
As a child, I really liked mathematics. I studied in a class with an in-depth study of mathematics and physics. I got acquainted with the Pascal programming language in computer science. However, later she decided to connect her life with the study of chemistry. Years later, I realized that my love for programming still remained, so I decided to start studying the IT field on my own. I started with Frontend Developer. It was very interesting, so I decided to continue studying and improve my skills.
I plan to develop in this area in the future.
